<h1> Kill The Goblin </h1>

Used <strong> Object Oriented Programming </strong> for creating this game using <strong> PyGame </strong> Library in <strong> Python</strong>.


It is a <strong>2D Game</strong> with Visual and Audio elements. It has been designed for single player and your opponent is the goblin. I have used 18 different images for rendering your character and used 22 different images for rendering the enemy(Goblin) character.
